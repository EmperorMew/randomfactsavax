Copy the script and paste it into your package. You can place the script in a separate file or incorporate it into an
existing file, depending on your project's structure and needs.
Import the script into the file where you want to use it. For example, if you placed the script in a file called
loading-screen.js, you can import it using import './loading-screen.js'.
Use the script to display the loading screen with a random fact. You can do this by calling the function that displays
the loading screen and passing it any necessary arguments. For example, if the function is called
displayLoadingScreen(), you can call it like this: displayLoadingScreen().
